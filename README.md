You and your piece of you — either via online multiplayer or couch co-op — will control Max and Cody, two play dolls that have been possessed (but not in a scary way) by a real-life Max and Cody, who are the in-the-process-of-getting-divorced parents of Rose. The dolls belong to Rose and it’ll be up to you and your Player 2 to determine why Rose has dolls of Max and Cody, why they’ve been possessed by Max and Cody, and ultimately, how to get back to Rose to see if she can reverse what’s happened.

## Walkthrough

The game is about love and the challenges of a relationship and it’s a great backdrop for the gameplay of It Takes Two, which will force you and your Player 2 to cooperate at essentially all times. Puzzles, platforming segments, bosses, and more must be solved together. This adventure will take Max and Cody to all sorts of locales at their house ranging from a shed with an evil toolbox to a tree that stands as the backdrop for a war between squirrels and wasps and more. That’s just the tip of the iceberg.
